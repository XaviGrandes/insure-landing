# Frontend Mentor - Insure landing page

![Design preview for the Insure landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Xavi Grandes and I coded this challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

I build a insurance landing page. first for mobile and then for desktop.
You will see a lot of css because of switching between devices

Users are able to:
- scroll page
- read text
- click buttons

On mobile there is a drop down menu that is displayed when you click on the hamburger menu and it changes to "X" to close.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS (BEM methodology and Saas)
- JavaScript
